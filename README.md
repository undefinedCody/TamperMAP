A web verb tampering tool that checks the status code and size of pretty much all HTTP methods for a given URL.

If you don't have access to Burp Suite or other tools like ffuf and you want to test an endpoint for web tampering vulnerability, this tool can help you to do so in the easiest way possible via Python.

# *Additional information:*

```--common``` Includes the following common HTTP methods:

```python
["GET", "HEAD", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "CONNECT", "OPTIONS", "TRACE", "PATCH"]
```

``` --all``` Includes all the HTTP methods available according to [source](https://github.com/for-GET/know-your-http-well/blob/master/methods.md):

```python
["ACL", "BASELINE-CONTROL", "BIND", "CHEKIN", "CHECKOUT", "CONNECT", "COPY", "DELETE", "GET", "HEAD", "LABEL", "LINK", "LOCK", "MERGE", "MKACTIVITY", "MKCALENDAR", "MKCOL", "MKREDIRECTREF", "MKWORKSPACE", "MOVE", "OPTIONS", "ORDERPATH", "PATCH", "POST", "PRI", "PROPFIND", "PROPPATCH", "PUT", "REBIND", "REPORT", "SEARCH", "TRACE", "UNBIND", "UNCHECKOUT", "UNLINK", "UNLOCK", "UPDATE", "UPDATEREDIRECTREF", "VERSION-CONTROL", "GIBBERISH", ""]

Please note that the last two methods were added to ensure that targets are being tested properly. Gibberish is an arbitrary non-existent method and the other one is basically empty.
